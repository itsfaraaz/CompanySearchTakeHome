Join our community Britt “Every developer has their own long-lived VM and because of that, people have made minor modifications here and there to the system.

I went through several different vendors and did and in-depth comparison, Skio seemed to be the most complete and after boarding I can say that the product holds true to expectations! Gio Diez Senior Growth Marketing Manager at about-face After evaluating other providers (e.g. Recharge, Bold, etc.), Skio was by far the easiest to implement both from a front-end & back-end perspective and the least complicated / fastest platform from a CX efficiency perspective. Kennan & the Skio team have been amazing to work with - extremely responsive & quick to roll out new requested features. Andy Chiu General Manager at Kravebeauty Our customer experience team has seen tickets about login issues reduce by >80% which has saved them hours.

Lastly, we love how responsive the Skio team has been in addressing any feature requests we have in record time. Kevin Lee Co-Founder of immi We migrated over from Recharge - overall the migration was pretty smooth, with some nuances around discount codes attached to subscriptions. There are friendlier features that separate Skio apart from other platforms such as gifting and group ordering which are nice. Ultimately, I chose Skio because I believe in the team's ability to iterate and innovate in this space. Lenny Chase CEO at Rasa Started off w/ Skio, havn't looked back.

ReadyOn is a platform for hiring and offering flexible work arrangements to your frontline workers in a modern app. We serve the largest enterprises who have hard-to-hire roles, high reliance on staffing agencies, and an interest in providing more schedule flexibility to their frontline workers. Is ReadyOn a staffing agency? What is the work arrangement? ReadyOn is a software platform, not a staffing agency. We drive applicants to your open roles to be hired as W2 “flex-time” workers of your organization. First popularized by Amazon, ”flex-time” workers are part-time W2 workers who choose their shifts each week – typically working below the benefits-eligibility hours threshold. How are applicants found, screened, and onboarded into my workforce? ReadyOn operates a job board and job advertising platform that targets workers seeking flexible work, enabling us to generate 2-5x more applicants than traditional job postings. You set the screening criteria and application process to ensure new candidates meet your hiring criteria without lowering the bar. Our platform then automatically screens and nudges applicants through your process -- working on behalf of your hiring managers to get them hired and onboarded. We connect into the leading Applicant Tracking Systems (e.g., Workday, SAP SuccessFactors) for enhanced automations. How does ReadyOn work with unionized workforces? Unionized workforces often have complex scheduling requirements and value flexibility for their members. ReadyOn automates scheduling processes required in collective bargaining agreements and creates an additional classification of “flex-time” union workers who have more flexibility and can work across nearby locations. How are ”flex-time” associates managed? ReadyOn has a suite of tools for supervisors to manage an increasingly dynamic workforce. Self-scheduling, notifications, performance tracking, recommendations, and predictions put staffing on auto-pilot so your managers can spend time on higher value tasks. Calculate the value of embracing flexibility Wages and related labor costs often comprise the largest expense for frontline employers, with room for 10-25% optimization.

Levo.ai,70,San Francisco,"Software has transformed completely in the last 2 decades: It’s API-first, cloud-native, AI-assisted and continuously deployed. Security hasn’t kept up, slowing down teams, deployment, and revenue. Reactive and manual security lead to security incidents, data breaches, bloated teams, compliance fines, and eroded brand value. Founded by a Former Cisco Engineering Director, Levo was built to ensure Security never slows down, drains revenue, but instead enables it. We proactively embed API Security best practices into your Developer workflows so better, more secure, compliant software is shipped faster. Levo is designed to be efficient, non-invasive. It operates with minimal cloud resources, so you can secure multiple attack surfaces without ballooning headcount or spend. Our intelligent data processing layer ensures no sensitive data ever leaves your environment. API Security is our first stride towards our vision of a world where Security and Growth are never trade-offs.",https://levo.ai,"Levo: Secure Your APIs with Powerful API Security Solutions We use essential cookies to make our site work.

Levo ensures you do neither, without exhausting resources and teams Automate API Security with Levo to eliminate security risks, costly overhead, and silos. Book a demo See how it works Trusted by leaders across industries Security can no longer be an afterthought right now. With the current influx of security incidents, security must always be built into the product code and architecture. I recommend Levo to enterprises because they approach API security with a similar mindset. Thanks to Levo, we now clearly understand how our applications have changed over the last year while continuously remediating vulnerabilities. Chaithanya Yambari Co-Founder at Zluri Levo allows embedding API discovery and security testing in the SDLC process at pre-production stages, which reduces the risks of exploits by bad actors and makes remediation more cost-efficient. Their innovative approach to API discovery, especially the eBPF agents that extract API endpoints, schema, authentication method, generate OpenAPI spec, and use the latter for API security testing, remains one of the most important use cases for an enterprise. Oleg G. Security Partner, 20+ years of Security experience Levo.ai is an exceptional developer friendly security platform custom built for the needs of modern API-first applications and agile DevOps driven deployments. Levo has done an excellent job at providing me with the confidence and assurance that every Engineering Leader needs through their continuous visibility, documentation and monitoring modules. If you are an Engineering Leader who is frustrated with constantly having to choose between pausing innovation or risking security, this platform is for you. It provides your applications with continuous, automated, and proactive security they need to secure growth levers. Suman Varanasi Co-Founder & CTO, Fello Before partnering with Levo, we had limited visibility into our APIs. However, their team has assisted us over the past year with API discovery and documentation and testing, maintaining data privacy, and regulatory compliance. This has led to a reduced attack surface and a significant increase in our developers' bandwidth. They have adeptly released custom features at high speed to meet our requirements. I would recommend them to any engineering and security leader seeking a long-term, effective solution to API-induced data breaches. Hemanth kumar Mangalore SVP Engineering, Angel One Levo has raised the bar for API security monitoring and testing. Their eBPF sensor is a game-changer for gaining valuable insights into our APIs with their Observability solution. As an early customer of Levo, I can confidently say that our partnership has been transformative. Levo has raised the bar for API security monitoring and testing. It's refreshing to see a team that delivers on complex requirements and constantly evolves to meet the latest security challenges successfully. Saran Makam VP of Information Security and IT (Former Head of Security and Customer Champion at Poshmark) 1 2 3 Software has evolved—API-first, DevOps-driven, and AI-assisted. 55%+ of enterprises now manage at least 500 APIs, with 60% updating them monthly or weekly. 74% of all Developers are API-First, not code first 92% of American developers leverage Gen AI and 88% increase in overall developer productivity Security hasn’t evolved, stalling revenue growth, data protection, and compliance Levo is the only security platform built for modern applications.

Built for efficiency Engineered with precision, Levo’s Satellite captures and processes only what’s necessary. Saving $100-500k in cloud costs even when deployed in the most demanding enterprise environments. No vendor-induced security concerns Less than 1% of your data is sent to our SaaS, compared to vendors who process all customer data within their SaaS No compromise on privacy Only metadata and OpenAPI specs are sent to our SaaS platform, and no PII ever leaves your environment Minimal resource requirement All 6 use cases performed with half a core CPU and 0.5GB RAM even at large enterprise scale High configuration flexibility Both our sensor and satellite can be configured directly from the UI saving time and cloud resources that would otherwise be spent relying on engineers. Compliance enabler, not blocker Ensure data remains within your jurisdiction with self-hosting/on-prem options. Frequently asked questions What is Levo? Levo offers an API Security Platform that automatically and continuously discovers, documents, tests, and monitors APIs—essential practices endorsed by OWASP and compliance frameworks like PCI. Due to the complexity of recommended security practices, over 60% of enterprises lack a robust API security strategy. This gap has led to widespread API breaches, with 57% of organizations experiencing incidents in the past two years. Levo has become indispensable to enterprise teams as we save them : A. 2-3 quarters of Developer bandwidth and >$1 million annual staffing costs B. $11 million in incident response costs by preventing/minimizing API breaches. Are there agentless instrumentation methods available? Yes, we offer a dozen-plus agentless instrumentation options that plug into your existing infrastructure and tools in addition to our eBPF and PCAP Sensors. Both agent and agentless deployments have their advantages and trade-offs. Our traffic-based instrumentation provides some of the most detailed and accurate inventory and documentation available. Yet its effectiveness depends on traffic quality. Since WAFs and many other edge-based tools capture edge traffic—mainly north-south communication—these agentless methods may miss internal APIs. While our eBPF sensor addresses this limitation, we recognize that installing agents requires significant resources and cross-departmental approval. Our one-click plugins for Gateways, Load Balancers, CDNs, and now WAFs give your teams immediate API visibility without upfront costs. Are all the API Security use cases limited to production? No, all of our use cases are capable of and meant to be deployed throughout the Software Development Lifecycle. 90% of critical security decisions happen before code reaches pre-production. By stepping in early, we enable the rectification of wrong decisions and support in making the right decisions. This ensures that exploit-proof applications are deployed instead of chasing false alerts in production. Is traffic instrumentation necessary? How is the traffic processed to avoid security risks and resource overruns? Our ability to discover, document, and test APIs primarily depends on access to their traffic. While code instrumentation is possible, the most crucial API parameters and API behavior are only visible in traffic. We begin by deploying our passive, out-of-band eBPF sensors (1 of our 12 instrumentation methods ) across environments to observe and collect API traffic, including SSL traffic. Instead of collecting everything (which could quickly amount to terabytes of data per day in high-performance environments), our agent smartly samples only what's necessary to create a conclusive and representative traffic profile. Thus, excessive data collection, processing, and duplication—common issues with traffic mirroring that drive up cloud costs—are avoided. Once collected, the sampled data is sent to our satellite for processing—a stark contrast to most vendors who process 100% of your data in their SaaS. After processing the traces, the satellite discards all of them, including those containing PII. You can choose to host the satellite yourself or have us host it. Either option maintains total capacity and can be deployed across all environments with a single click. Built using microservices, our stateless satellite supports Kubernetes , VMs, and serverless architecture and doesn’t require any updates to your Firewall configurations.

CloudFiles,114,Fremont,"A Sales team typically uses 5-6 document tools: 1. Document generation tool for creating personalized proposal/contracts etc. using a template & customer data. Ex: Conga composer, Panda Docs, Quip. 2. Document Storage tool for storing files in a cloud storage. Ex: SharePoint, Google Drive, Salesforce. 3. Document Discovery tool for finding the right content in the business context. Ex: Seismic, Highspot. 4. Document Sharing tool for sharing documents with customers & tracking engagement. Ex: Showpad, DocSend. 5. E-signatures tool to Esign on documents. Ex: DocuSign, HelloSign Problems with current document stack is that: 1. These tools don’t talk to each other. 2. They add a lot of friction to the sales process. 3. Sales people have to keep jumping between these tools. 4. Sensitive files & customer data is scattered across these platforms. 5. They don’t integrate well with the existing processes. Enter CloudFiles which is a full stack document automation & sharing platform. It is: a) Friction Eliminator: 1. Exposed through the CRMs - acts as CRM extension & not as a new tool 2. Mirrors existing storage - Works on top of SharePoint, Google Drive etc. Customer’s sensitive files remain with them. b) Deeply Integrated: 1. CRMs are very powerful at automations, it’s their core business. 2. CloudFiles deeply integrates with these tools, harnessing the full power of CRMs. c) Full Stack: 1. CloudFiles would support all functions across document lifecycle, with an option to plug user’s own tool as well. 2. Ex: Someone wants to use DocuSign instead of our e-signatures, they can, in a seamless way. d) Highly Customizable: 1. All sales processes are unique. Salesforce understood that and pioneered CRMs. 2. CloudFiles takes the same approach, building on top of CRMs, enabling customers to fully customize their processes involving documents.

Beth Mack | Owner/Manager | Barnes Greenhouses With Plantiful inventory will live update. So then taking inventory is not a huge to-do each week anymore. I also really like the QR codes, because they make it really easy to give everyone quick mobile access. Amanda Thomas | Assistant Head Grower | Forest Lake Greenhouses When you have older growers with lots of knowledge, that information on how they've handled these crops year to year is not written down anyplace. Here it is in Plantiful! And a to-do list for my meetings with the growers every week is gonna be generated by tasks. That's really cool! Carolyn Barlow | Production Manager | Olson’s Greenhouses The digital records we can keep with Plantiful will be exactly what inspectors want to see. Luke Venable | Head Grower | Forest Lake Greenhouses From growing, to inventory, to selling, to picking, I think a lot gets missed, and in Plantiful it all talks to each other, so you can make one change, and it's visible to everyone everywhere.

Currently Apokto uses several closed and open source LLMs, including GPT-4. We’re currently taking a unique approach that involves building an in-house suite of Small Language Models (SLMs) that are fine-tuned for the complexities and nuances of finance. This bespoke methodology offers several benefits: Data Security : By not depending on third-party APIs like OpenAI, Apokto ensures that sensitive financial data remains within the control of the client’s environment, mitigating potential security risks associated with external data processing. Customization : Apokto’s models are specifically tailored to the tasks and data of the finance sector, leading to higher accuracy and relevance in outputs such as financial forecasting, risk assessment, and reporting. Performance : The SLMs are optimized for the specific computational and data needs of financial operations, leading to faster processing times and more efficient data handling compared to generalized models. Cost Efficiency : Avoiding external API calls can reduce operational costs, as it eliminates the fees associated with these services and the need for excessive data transfer bandwidth. Continuous Improvement : Since the models are proprietary, Apokto has the agility to rapidly iterate and improve upon them based on user feedback and emerging financial trends. Regulatory Compliance : Having complete ownership of the AI technology allows for better alignment with financial regulations and compliance standards, which is a critical concern for financial institutions."

Además, puedes acumular créditos de conocimiento. Te damos valor estratégico constante, incluso sin ejecución. Yo ya tengo equipo comercial, ¿para qué pagar esto? Tu equipo de ventas cierra, tu equipo de mercadeo siembra. Pero ¿quién les entrega clientes listos para cerrar en tiempo real? ¿No es mejor pagar por proyecto cuando lo necesite? Puedes hacerlo, pero perderás tiempo valio$o en briefings, procesos, y disponibilidad. La suscripción te da acceso inmediato, mejor precio por unidad y trato preferencial. Es como entrar por la puerta VIP. ¿Y si quiero cancelar? Sin cláusulas de permanencia. Puedes suspender con 15 días de aviso. El modelo es de confianza mutua, no de ataduras. ¿Y si después me sale más caro que buscar otro proveedor puntual? Nosotros ya hicimos esa tarea : El CAC aislado no es suficiente. Se compara contra el LTV (valor del cliente en el tiempo) para saber si la inversión en adquisición es rentable. Regla financiera común: LTV / CAC ≥ 3 (por cada dólar invertido en adquirir, se deben recuperar al menos 3). ¿Por qué confiar en ustedes? ¿Qué los hace distintos? Porque no somos una agencia de mercadeo que intenta hacer ventas ni un BPO cobrando por hacer llamadas. Somos una empresa de tecnología que domina perfectamente el proceso de pre-venta, venta y post-venta de tecnología IT. Es decir, somos de tu equipo. ¿Y si pido un SQL y no convierte? La calidad del SQL está 100% garantizada: entregamos contactos con presupuesto, autoridad, necesidad, cronograma y disposición a avanzar. Cumplimos con todos los criterios que definen una oportunidad calificada para la compra de tecnología informática —tú sabes que no es lo mismo que vender cualquier otro producto o servicio-. Con esto, el vendedor podrá ejercer su rol de cierre. Así funciona un engranaje sano entre producto y vendedor.

ProComplyNet,218,New York,"We are driven to help our clients optimize ROI while reducing risk. Capital is invested into Assets, People support Assets, Compliance ensures People are doing the right things. We use technology AI to simplify how employees interact with assets. Operations, Safety, Environmental, Maintenance, Procurement all have touchpoints in maximizing an assets potential and reducing its risk, but all the specialty software systems for each department leave the boots on the ground confused, and overworked.

Instead of focusing on individual metrics, we focus on the area where everyone overlaps, Assets! An asset is a broad class but our focus is on Fixed Equipment, Fixed Property, Mobile Equipment, Inventory, and Capital.

I've only exited 20 people, and normally I'm exiting 100 people at a time. And some of these people that I'm exiting off have actually completed the program, so they're not even exits because they're not in compliance — they're exits because they're housed.” Junisa Dailey Operations Manager, Fathers and Mothers Who Care “Kiip is a cultural shift.

Our clients typically generate annual revenues ranging from 1 million to 50 million. Businesses of this size often operate without a large finance team, or any finance team at all. However, having clean books, tracking the correct KPIs, and automating manual tasks are still critical to growing the business. What industries do you work with? We have worked with car dealerships, e-commerce brands, art fairs, design galleries, therapy practices, VC funds (the GP), and more. Our core principals of clean books and world-class finance operations apply to companies across all industries. What kind of financial reports do you provide? After reconciling your books each month, we provide standard financial statements including an updated P&L, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. We also collaborate with your team to develop and maintain custom reports. Examples of these include financial forecasts, dashboards highlighting critical KPIs, cash flow reports with runway analysis, and P&L breakdown by deal, among others. How much does this cost? Every business has unique needs. Some ask us to simply review their bookkeeper's work. Some require forecasting and monthly reconciliation. Others ask us to bring a team and become their finance function. Our services typically start at $1,000 per month. Please contact us to discuss your specific needs. What accounting solutions do you work with? At this time we only work with Quickbooks. How do you leverage automation in your bookkeeping services? Manual, repetitive tasks tend to have higher error rates and are costly because that time can be used more efficiently. We believe in automating as many manual tasks as possible. Some examples include invoices that are created in Quickbooks and sent to customers, processing bills due to vendors & contractors, assigning the best clients to the best salespeople, pulling KPIs from various sources into a Dashboard, and many others.

Explore hidden insights​ Gain a fresh perspective on your information as our AI unveils insightful relationships, adding depth and breadth to your understanding. Ask better questions Chat naturally with our AI chatbot, Izzy, to improve how you ask questions and get smarter, context-based answers from your information. Empower your teams​ Work seamlessly with your team by sharing data insights and creating tasks, all within the Workbench.​ Graph technology can serve as a Symantec search layer by enhancing the search capabilities with graph-based algorithms and data structures Here’s how it can be implemented: Data Indexing Graph databases can index not only the data itself but also the relationships between data points. When a user performs a search query, the graph database can quickly traverse the graph to locate relevant data points based on their relationships, significantly speeding up the search process compared to traditional search engines. Learn More Semantic Search Graph technology enables semantic search, allowing users to find information based on the meaning and context of their query rather than just keyword matching. By understanding the relationships between different data elements, the search layer can provide more accurate and relevant results to users. Learn More Contextual Understanding Graph databases excel at capturing contextual information, which is crucial for effective search. By modeling relationships between different entities, the search layer can take into account the context in which data points exist, leading to more precise search results. Learn More Relationship-based Ranking In addition to keyword relevance, graph-based search engines can rank search results based on the strength and relevance of the relationships between data points. This helps prioritize the most relevant information for the user, improving the overall search experience. Learn More Faceted Search Graph databases support faceted search, allowing users to refine their search results based on various attributes and relationships. Users can navigate through different facets of the data to drill down to the most relevant information, making it easier to find what they’re looking for. Learn More Graph Analytics Beyond simple keyword search, graph technology enables advanced analytics on the data graph. Users can perform complex graph queries and algorithms to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and derive insights from the data, providing a deeper understanding of the information landscape. Learn More Real-time Search With the ability to traverse relationships quickly, graph-based search layers can support real-time or near-real-time search queries. This is especially beneficial in dynamic environments where data is constantly changing, allowing users to access the most up-to-date information. Learn More Integration with Existing Systems Graph search layers can integrate with existing Symantec systems and data sources, providing a unified interface for searching across disparate data silos. This enables organizations to leverage their existing investments in Symantec products while enhancing search capabilities with graph technology.

Our pipeline compares the impact to ensure that the accuracy or the objective function of the network is negligibly impacted.

Each of their travelers takes an onboarding quiz, and our custom ChatGPT integration forms the recommendation engine in the middle - it’s able to instantly understand the traveler’s preferences and make a fully vetted itinerary straight from the custom data.

Not every contractor they talk to will be familiar with the new equipment, and there are a lot of rebates offered by municipalities and utilities that they may not be aware of. QuitCarbon needed a way to automatically evaluate contractors' bids according to a set of internal criteria. The bids come in all manner of formats, from highly rigorous printouts to handwritten notes. Fusible's system ensures that no matter what format the bid is received in, it gets expressed and evaluated as clean data. ""Looking at bids was a challenge - there's a whole variety of data we need to get out of them, and they're super messy by nature. But there's no point trying to get contractors to standardize.

We built logic to combine ChangeEngine's extensive library of the best HR communications in every category with a style guide unique to each company and integrate it all into ChatGPT. ""We didn't want to ship a vanilla AI feature, and we had a lot of great data to leverage. But we weren't sure exactly which direction to move in - there's a lot of contradictory guidance out there and it's tough to cut through the noise and hype.

Sprectroo,375,Santa Clara,"Sprectroo is a subsidiary of Ailynix that has created a AI-Driven Derivatization and Repurposing Platform that incorporates Deep Learning, Blockchain and Genomics.",http://sprectroo.com,"Sprectroo Harnessing the power of Deep Learning, Blockchain and Genomics in Drug Derivatization & Repositioning Rethinking Drug Derivatization , Repositioning and Development utilizing Deep Learning, Blockchain & Omics Data Driven Approach to Drug Derivatization , Repositioning using Gene-Disease Associations Previous Next Mission Given the high attrition rates, substantial costs and slow pace of new drug discovery and development, repurposing of 'old' drugs to treat both common and rare diseases is increasingly becoming an attractive proposition. It’s the vision of Sprectroo Founding Team to collaborate with international Pharma and Biotechnology companies identifying promising candidate drugs, some of which maybe in advanced stages of clinical trials, with the potential for use in the treatment of both common and rare diseases, utilize our AIDDRP to create new candidates or improve already approved drugs that are part of their pipeline. Definition Drug Repurposing is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope of the original medical indication. Drug Derivatization is a technique used in chemistry which transforms a chemical compound into a product of similar chemical structure, called a derivative. Drug repositioning for personalized medicine Human diseases can be caused by complex mechanisms involving aberrations in numerous proteins and pathways. With recent advances in genomics, elucidating the molecular basis of disease on a personalized level has become an attainable goal. In many cases, relevant molecular targets will be identified for which approved drugs already exist, and the potential repositioning of these drugs to a new indication can be investigated. Personalized medicine and repositioning both aim to improve the productivity of current drug discovery pipelines. Personalized medicine and repositioning approaches are poised to significantly alter the way we diagnose diseases, infer treatments and develop new drugs. The heterogeneity and complexity of human diseases has an important role in drug efficacy. In light of this disease heterogeneity, the focus of Sprectroo scientific team is on personalized diagnosis of patients and prescribing drugs tailored to the individual's molecular biology of the disease. AIDRRP is a Genomics Driven Drug Derivatization and Repositioning Platform that implements Deep Learning, (DL) with Blockchain and Genomics de novo design technology called ""derivatization design and discovery"" that applies artificial-intelligence-assisted forward in Silico synthesis for the generation of near neighbor lead analogues as well as scaffold variations. The several attractive features of the methodology include synthetic feasibility, reagent availability and cost data associated with each new molecule; thus, detailed synthetic assessment is automatically generated during the design.

Don't just take our word for it Muralidharan Sundarajan Former head of procurement Post Covid, geo-political turmoil and looming recession have increased the complexity and expectations of CPO or Procurement function at large - with high visibility at CEO and board levels - as procurement function have become more strategic. Apart from Right Product, Right Price and Right Quantity, ensuring the Right Value is becoming critical for companies. Companies need to invest in next-gen procurement technologies to bring in analytics/ visualization, predictive analytics, deployment of RPA for recurring or transactional activities with AI / Cognitive capabilities.. these are not buzz words anymore. With the number of ""recurring"" purchases, the transactional volumes have gone up significantly and effective solutions are required to help with both transactional as well as strategic part of procurement. I am excited about the approach Krayo is taking to solve the problem. As a procurement practitioner, I love the fact that they look at Corp Spend holistically from a procurement lens which is more strategic than transactional. Done right, this could be transformational for companies. Ross Tennenbaum CFO The ability to access data-based benchmarks is critical for any finance professional. Today, these benchmarks are often not readily available, requiring me to resort to informal information checks sourced manually through my network. To have a curated, more real-time benchmark feed would be game-changing and I would pay for that service in a heartbeat. Vijay A M Finance Today most companies have signed up for a long list of SaaS/software vendors. During sign up the contracts are primed for maximum usage to get best discounts, rates etc. Over the years the actual usage of the SaaS products forms a very small portion of the contracted capacity. I have seen cases where 300 employees were issued a subscription for a product and less than 50 of them had logged into the product in a year and only 10 were regular users. For a Finance/Commercials team it is difficult to realize who are using various subscriptions if we are paying more than what we are using for. Complicating the matters further, most SaaS billings are auto-charged to credit cards or are renewed annually there by cutting out the review mechanism from the payment for the product. This is where a product like Krayo can play a key role by bringing together all spends and linking it to the usage across the organization. The data comes from Krayo is independent from the vendor or end-user team, both of which usually do not provide usage data to finance easily. Vivek Singal Co-founder As we were growing, adoption of technology and tools became a natural choice for us in various aspects of running business. And thanks to multiple providers which made this really possible for me, be it in the field of development, HR, finance, sales etc. you think of it and the tool exists with more than a dozen provider. But eventually it became a challenge for me to manage so many vendors, track billing, track usage within organisation and justify using the services. The more I think, the larger the problem occurs to me. And then I encountered Krayo and it’s founder who had just picked a piece from my mind and were working on it. And this is just an initial part of their broader platform story. I would describe Krayo as a great productivity tool that uses AI to bring real time decision making at one's fingertips. Technology driven integrations provides deeper understanding of diverse data sets. I am waiting for full blown versions of Krayo to come out. Vikas Gupta Procurement Head At Innovaccer, we manage a broad swathe of requests across functions and regions (US, UAE, INDIA), and keeping pace with the business groups is always a priority. Needless to say, Procurement needs to cut across other support functions i.e., Finance, Legal, IT, and Compliance, in order to fulfill these requisitions. At times it becomes hard for us to drive visibility across the teams on the process and serve the BUs to the best of our abilities. Krayo brings in a lot of promise to completely turn things around for us. A single platform for Corp Spend sounds like a dream which I really wish to see as a reality soon. From full cross-functional visibility to defining the policies we want and getting its compliance; from parallel workflows to automated reports and analytics; there's just a lot to look forward to and embrace.

INTEGRATIONS Integrate with industry leading tools FAQs Frequently Asked Questions What is an order-to-cash (OTC or O2C) process? Order-to-cash is a complex business process that manages customer’s sales order, fulfilment, invoicing, and customer payment. Streamlining this process and enabling with an intelligent solution will help improve company’s cash flow, revenues and business growth. Why is it important for professional services? In the professional services industry (mainly IT services), the statement of work contract terms along with customer purchase orders drives the project delivery, invoicing, and customer payments. To have efficient and smooth operations, it is important to tightly align the process steps. This will enable optimized resource utilization, submission of error-free invoices as per the terms of the contract, faster payments, and happier customers. What are the detailed steps of the O2C process in service industry? O2C process starts with capturing of information from approved statement of work and customer purchase orders such as what project is being delivered, PO amount, by whom, and when the project should be completed. Order fulfilment is handled by putting together a project team by leveraging the right resources and managing their utilization. Based on the project contract type, the project time, expenses, and milestones are captured. With prompt approvals the invoices are distributed to the customer error-free and on-time. The reporting and notification keep the project sales and accounts team abreast of any pending payments thus reducing any backlogs. The reconciliation process with financial accounting systems provides information on key metrics that can enable better decision-making. How does this improve cash flow? By digitizing and automating your order-to-cash process, you’ll have constant access to each phase of the process at all times – lessening the risk of loss that comes with hardcopy invoicing. Efficient data exchange and transparency between the project teams within your business and customer allows you to identify payment backlogs proactively, streamline your collection management and protect your revenue.

I love how you can connect and find other users without being concerned about a feed and the number of connections you have. I’m a fresh grad and I’ve been able to find a mentor who’s helping with my job search. So glad this is out there! analystSF , 08/25/2021 Limited Interaction / Needs More Members I joined this as an alternative to LinkedIn. I swiped through every member in about 20 min and got 2 “matches”. It is unclear what constitutes a match (I assume you both chose to “connect”. I was very excited about the mentoring aspect of this app. I couldn’t find anything to support this other than listing in your bio you want to be or meet a mentor and for another person to decide to message you. It only allows for 5 jobs in employment history and limited text for bio/ skills. There are currently 2 jobs posted. Future releases need to add functionality or change verbiage in platform description. Needs significant improvement. Seems to be at minimal viable product level. I will see if any developments are introduced in the upcoming weeks or will delete this app after reducing rating. dj2265 , 05/25/2021 Networking hasn’t been easier Networking has always been a challenge for me.

Tag Operations,410,San Francisco,"Tag Ops was born from the idea that all companies need Back Office support regardless of their size. However, not all companies have a need for full-time HR, Finance, or Operations leaders to drive big back office initiatives.

We learn what our clients needs are; research and investigate what the best (and most cost effective) tools, processes, and policies would be; and implement from there.

See what our clients are saying ""Courtney, in short, has transformed the back-end operations of our business. She started with bare bones and made an immediate, dramatic impact. She documented processes that improved candidate and internal employee experience, created more reports than I can count that gave excellent insight into our sales function, and fully owned and improved our routine operational processes."" ""Courtney / Tag Ops more than delivered on her engagement with DiversityZoom. As a small business owner, we were impressed with the structure, speed, and strategic mindset provided as early as the discovery call, through to the final deliverables. Working with Tag Ops resulted in immediate impact in our P&L and business roadmap, and a lot of ""oh, that's cool"" from our executive team in response to suggested solutions. We appreciated how Courtney / TagOps took the time to maintain project timelines and incorporate continuous feedback throughout the engagement. We plan to work with TagOps for our future needs, and wholeheartedly recommend TagOps."" ""It is rare to find a talent like Courtney. She is intelligent, proactive, and professional. She tackles projects through thoughtful planning and then executes projects flawlessly. If she doesn't know how to do something, she dives into research and figures out a strategy."" ""Working with Courtney was an absolute pleasure. She helped the IT team greatly in our interactions and took responsibility even for items that were not in her field of responsibility and brought them to the next level. We always felt she was a part of the team and her organisational skills are some of the best I have seen. Anyone would be happy to have her work in their company."" ""Courtney’s been a pleasure and joy to work with and always very responsive. With a ""no task too small"" mentality, she has been an incredible resource to us. I would highly recommend her to anyone in need of her services!"" ""Courtney has been vital to a project in which we helped open an interability coffee shop in Atlanta Georgia, where she was pivotal in all the software integrations, setup policies, procedures, and documentation."" Frequently Asked Questions Your Back Office (HR, Finance, Ops) is running into issues with processes that are siloed, inconsistent, undocumented, and poorly organized, leading to disjointed workflows and confusion about roles. With duplicated systems and multiple sources of truth, your team spends valuable time on internal audits, unsure of where to find the most accurate information and reports. Without a dedicated operations team being the oil between departments, fixing the broken system can seem costly, yet focusing on fixing and organizing your back office instead of growth and strategy isn’t sustainable. Tag Ops steps in to streamline, standardize, and integrate your back office, helping you shift your focus back to strategic growth. The earlier you focus on your systems and processes, the less time and money you spend fixing and cleaning them up when you scale. Gain the expertise of an experienced Operations team at a fraction of the cost, freeing up time for you to focus on your core services, products, and overall company strategy. Access multiple custom dashboards and databases for a high-level perspective of your business, helping you make informed decisions quickly. This team doesn’t just offer consulting but actively implements solutions, taking the time to understand the nuances of your company, recommend the best approaches, and build tailored systems and processes that meet your specific needs."

Traxn Inc.,446,New York,"AI Powered All-In-One Marketing Suite For Coaches, Consultants & Service Providers. 🎯",https://traxn.co,"Traxn | Automate Your Coaching Business AUTOMATE YOUR 2025: ONGOING 10X Growth. Zero Burnout. Full Automation. No fluff. Just proven systems that scale your business while saving you time. Empowering coaches & consultants monetize with proven systems Transform Your Business Using AI SYSTEMS & Automation. Burn the busywork. Build bigger with killer Automation Systems, ruthless frameworks, and AI workflows—Zero Fluff, All Fire. Destroy Your Busywork With Powerful Systems That Run While You Sleep... Scale faster and smarter with systems that handle the heavy lifting, giving you more time to focus on what matters... Coaching or Sleeping. The Traxn Coaching OS Here's what our AI + Automation system does to your coaching business ""The Most Innovative Marketing System Ever Designed for Coaches ..."" From The Desk Of Shamnas CEO, Traxn Inc. Dear Coach, Most online coaches today are sitting on a GOLDMINE of untapped potential, yet they barely scratch the surface of what they could achieve. They’re caught in the daily grind, focused on the immediate tasks, and missing out on the GOLDEN opportunity to compete with coaches, both established and beginners. The reason? They haven’t had the opportunity to UNLOCK THE POWER of systems & automation that is available now to propel them into a league of their own. IMAGINE THIS... A coach with INCREDIBLE program or reputation, brimming with potential, yet struggling to break through the noise while established competitors effortlessly DOMINATE the market. It's not just because the established coaches or consultants have more resources... It's because they've CRACKED THE CODE on automation, particularly in their marketing. WE’VE BUILT SYSTEMS THAT NEVER SLEEP—WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO DRIVE LEADS, ENGAGE CUSTOMERS, BOOK APPOINTMENTS, CONVERT PROSPECTS, AND COLLECT PAYMENTS. WITHOUT LIFTING A FINGER. Meanwhile, too many coaches & consultants are stuck in the old ways—manually posting on social media, sending out emails, and desperately trying to keep pace with the ever-changing digital landscape. But this approach is like trying to WIN A RACE on foot while others are zooming by in flashy cars & big houses... Without automation & systems, you’re leaving vast amounts of MONEY on the table, missing out on endless opportunities to reach new clients and scale your business. AUTOMATION ISN’T JUST A TOOL; IT’S THE KEY TO UNLOCKING YOUR BUSINESS’S FULL POTENTIAL. It’s about creating a marketing engine that RUNS ON AUTOPILOT , while optimizing and refining to keep you ahead of the competition. Whether you’re a freelance consultants or the mastermind behind a coaching empire, ignoring these systems is the difference between merely surviving and truly THRIVING. In a world where every second counts, those who fail to embrace marketing automation will watch their competitors soar past them. But for those who dare to seize this opportunity... THE SKY’S THE LIMIT. And the coaches & consultants that harness the power of automation won't just compete... THEY'LL DOMINATE. I GUESS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SAY IS... IT'S TIME TO START AUTOMATING YOUR DAMN BUSINESS. IT'S TIME TO BUILD POWERFUL SYSTEMS. Common Questions From Coaches Get answers to the most common questions coaches & consultants ask us How Do I Know If I am A Fit? If you are a coach or consultant offering services online or looking for generating leading and sales online...Then you are a perfect fit. We won't onboard you if we think the system will not work for your business. What Kind Of Results Can I Expect? You can expect streamlined systems between your sales, marketing, and even onboarding. We build you strategic systems for each that are running behind you.This includes your offers, landing pages, lead collection & distribution, automated marketing, automated lead nurturing calendar integrations, and even things like automating your payment collections... And the list goes on. With our systems in place, you will be able to run traffic to your business while everything else is running automatically on the back end for you. How Much Does This Cost? It totally depends on your business model and that's the reason and requirements. For example, if you are not going to use the AI Cold Calling, You are not going to charge for it. Let's discuss this over a call. How Long Does It take To See Results? Most of our clients see results within a month after the system is deployed! What Does The Setup Process Look like? We will meet with you 1-on-1, run through your entire customer journey with you on call, then get started building your custom system for you. Our team will have ongoing communication with you to make sure things are exactly how they should be based on your business. How's The After Sale Support?

We recruit internationally but rest assured that our VAs have gone through a rigorous interview process and training before we send them out to our clients. What happens if my VA leaves without notice? While we do our best to create an environment and a team of committed individuals, it is possible that members of the team will leave. Should your VA decide to leave, we will prioritize identifying and training a new VA fit for the role. Typically, we have a pool of VAs on standby and ready to start within 7 days (excluding the interview process). What if my VA is not performing to my expectations? The job description of each role is clearly defined and the VAs are trained accordingly. Additionally, we assess our VAs to establish what role they would be best suited for. If an assigned task is beyond their job scope, then it is expected that they may not be able to deliver to your expectations and may need additional training. How do you select your VAs? We recruit our Virtual Assistants through local advertising, social media, and referrals from our trusted sources. We’ve discovered that this results in an enhanced degree of loyalty and commitment, which translates into excellent service for our clients and reduced staff turnover due to job discontent. We want to provide our employees with a long-term and meaningful “career”, and not a “temporary” job. Do you provide training to your VAs? Yes, we provide them with both theoretical and hands-on training. The duration is dependent on the role you are hiring for. How long does the VA hiring process take? After filling out our VA Request form and signing the contract. The interview schedule will be sent within 24-48 hours. The whole hiring process, including interviews and training (depending on the position), might take up to 21 days. Do you have VAs ready to start immediately? Our goal is to match our clients with the right VAs in order to craete a positive client-VA relationship and a positive work environment. Typically, we recruit to meet your specifications and have VAs on stand-by and ready to start in 7 days (excluding the interview process).
